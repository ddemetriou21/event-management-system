# event-management-system

playing around with python to be able to create an event management system
that stores all the user information in a json file. (not optimal but wanted to be able 
to store the information somehow. This was before I learned how to be able to connect 
to an SQL database and update the information directly to the server.)

there are 2 versions within this file, one with the system as it is, handling
event and user creations, editing event and user information and updating it to the 
correct file.

the second version is pretty much the same as the first one with the exception of a login 
function that checks with the JSON file.
